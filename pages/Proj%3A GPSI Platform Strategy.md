	- ## What If
		- We make #ClearPath take #GPSI #devices configs
		- #migrate all [[Channel Partners]] to #ClearPath
		- Consume all data through #kafka
		  collapsed:: true
			- Then we can have a "router" push to #GPSI or #ClearPath
			- If we could have 360 consume the same shape of data for both #GPSI and #ClearPath
			- This would make the 360 platform be the single pane of glass that [[Channel Partners]] want
			- Then #gpsi-he would manage devices and #cp-soheil would be able to focus on platform development
