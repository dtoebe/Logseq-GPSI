## What If
	- We make #ClearPath take #GPSI #devices configs
	- #migrate all [[Channel Partners]] to #ClearPath
	- Consume all data through #kafka
		- Then we can have a "router" push to #GPSI or #ClearPath
		- If we could have 360 consume the same shape of data for both #GPSI and #ClearPath
		- This would make the 360 platform be the single pane of glass that [[Channel Partners]] want
		- Then #gpsi-he would manage devices and #cp-soheil would be able to focus on platform development
